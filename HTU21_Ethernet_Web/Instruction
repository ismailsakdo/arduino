Upload Generic Sketch from your Arduino IDE - Examle > Ethernet > DhcpAdressPrinter
Make sure UPLOAD without attached the Arduino Ethernet Sheild (maybe yours ok, but mine, I need to upload Without the Sheild)
Attached the Ethernet Sheild and RESTART the arduino by pressing the RESTART
Open Serial Monitor and write down your IP Address.
Open the Sketch (HTU21_Ethernet_Web), then change the IP Address with your IP Address
Detach/ remove the sheild and UPLOAD the code (HTU21_Ethernet_Web) that already change their IP corresponding with your IP
Now Attached your sensor with your sheild, The arrangement will be Sensor to Arduino:
+ attached with the 5V; - attached with the Ground Arduino; DA attached with the A4 of arduino; and CL attached with the A5 (standard I2C)
Attached the Arduino Ethernet Sheild after the Code Successfully uploaded on your arduino (without  the Ethernet Sheild)
Plug in your LAN cable, restart the Unit
Open your browser and Enter the IP address that you obtained in the step 4
The data is reasy to be use gathered from the site (sensor of arduino) and published in your Webserver via your dedicated IP
Enjoy
